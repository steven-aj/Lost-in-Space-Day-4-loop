As a quick introduction to for-loops in programming, I've created a code sample for Day 4 of the 'Lost in Space' by Inventr.io.

Download 'Lost in Space - Day 4 - for-loop.ino', or click on its link above & copy the code into your Arduino IDE.

Read the comments within the code as you follow along each line & don't be afraid to change the pin values in each array.

Have fun!
